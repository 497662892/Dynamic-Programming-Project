## Introduction

This project is the implementation of my final project "Improving Synthetic Sample Selections with Method
Inspired by Dynamic Programming"

The high level idea of this work is to propose a synthetic data sample strategy that can consider both of the distribution of original data and the already selected data. To overcome the limitation of "random selection" and "prediction base selection"
